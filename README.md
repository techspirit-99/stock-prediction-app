A machine learning application that predicts stock prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. This project analyzes historical stock market data to forecast future price movements and help make informed investment decisions.​

🚀 Features
Real-time stock data fetching using yfinance API

LSTM neural network for time series prediction

Interactive visualizations of historical and predicted prices

Support for multiple stock tickers

Model performance evaluation with MSE/RMSE metrics

Price trend analysis and forecasting

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

TensorFlow/Keras - Deep learning framework for LSTM model

Pandas - Data manipulation and analysis

NumPy - Numerical computing

yfinance - Real-time stock data fetching

Matplotlib/Plotly - Data visualization

Scikit-learn - Data preprocessing and metrics

📦 Installation
Clone the repository

💻 Usage
Run the application

bash
python app.py
Enter stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL, TSLA)

View predictions and visualizations

Example:

python
# Predict stock prices for Apple
ticker = "AAPL"
predictions = model.predict(ticker)
📊 Model Architecture
Model Type: Sequential LSTM

Layers:

LSTM layer with 50 units and ReLU activation

Dropout layer for regularization

Dense output layer

Training: 30 epochs with batch size of 32

Data Split: 80% training, 20% testing

Optimizer: Adam

Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

📈 Results
Training MSE: 0.034

Test MSE: 0.0024

Prediction Accuracy: Model successfully captures stock price trends and movements

Visualization shows predictions closely following actual price patterns
